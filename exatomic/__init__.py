Exatomic
#############
This package provides a unified data format for organizing, analyzing, and
visualizing data coming from the most common computational chemistry software
programs.

Note:
    Although the package is called exatomic, some class and function names are
    shortened to just atomic.

Warning:
    This package uses the `atomic`_ unit system - all quantities appear in
    atomic units!
