The exatomic code base can be conceptually organized in terms of the following
aspects.

1. Core API: Provide users with an efficient data representation, analysis framework,
   and visualization environment for data from quantum mechanical calculations
2. Third software support: extensions that enable parsing of externally created
   data into the exatomic framework for analysis and visualization
3. Education: Use of the symbolic and numerical methods, coupled with the interactive
   visualization tools to teach quantum mechanics
