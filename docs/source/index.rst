*A unified platform for theoretical and computational chemists*

This package provides a platform for computational and theoretical chemists
and physicists to parse, process, analyze, and visualize data coming from 
quantum mechanics calculations. Included in this package are sub-packages 
dedicated to parsing data from software programs used in the field. A quick 
method to get started with visualization is through the `Jupyter notebook`_.
